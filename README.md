Othello
=======

A simple Othello game to be played inside the [Light Table](http://www.lighttable.com/) editor.

The AI is just random at the moment, I plan to implement some of the techniques from Peter Norvig's excellent 'Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming' when I have time...

After installation, run *Othello: Start New Game* to play against the computer (you are always playing black, for now).
